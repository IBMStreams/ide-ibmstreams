# ide-ibmstreams [Beta]
IBM Streams support for Atom-IDE using the IBM Streams SPL langauge server.

### Beta
This is the initial public release.  For best results should also install these Atom packages:
* language-ibmstreams-spl 
* streams-dark-syntax
* streams-light-syntax
* atom-ide-ui
* build-ibmstreams

### Setup Instructions
#### Build
You need an IBM Streaming Analytics service to build and run your Streams applications.  

#### Toolkit Folder
The IBM Streams product toolkits are bundled with this package.  If your Streams application uses additional toolkits you need to copy those to a folder on your workstation and set the configuration property: toolkitsPath to this folder.
